Hypothesis prioritization and A/B test analysis

##  Project Description
This project focuses on prioritizing hypotheses using ICE and RICE frameworks 
and analyzing the results of an A/B test to evaluate changes in user behavior.

##  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

##  Key Analysis
- Hypothesis prioritization (ICE & RICE)
- Conversion rate comparison
- Revenue analysis
- Statistical significance testing

##  Outcome
Based on the test results, data-driven recommendations are provided regarding 
the implementation of the tested changes.
